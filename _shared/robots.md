# `robots.txt`

The `robots.txt` file would replace the one in the root. But, the `cms-site-resources` repo is not designed for overriding nor supplementing root files. The `robots.txt` file is here only so it is not lost (when `texascale-org` repo id deleted). As of 2020-11-30, [texascale.org](https://texascale.org) is the only stand-alone Django CMS website to use a `robots.txt`.

## To Do

Allow `robots.txt` per site via plugin (which allows CMS user to author `robots.txt` and CMS to generate `robots.txt`).
