# TACC CMS Per-Site Resources - Example - Configuration

# In a project-specific configuration file like this, edit existing configuration values from `cms-site-template:/taccsite_cms/default_secrets.py` that must change to suit this project.

# Until this custom configuration is automatically applied, to use it one must copy the content of it and append it to `cms-site-template:/taccsite_cms/secrets.py`
